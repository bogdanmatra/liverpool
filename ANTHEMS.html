<h2 align= "center"> 1. You’ll Never Walk Alone </h2>

Written by Rogers and Hammerstein for the 1945 Broadway musical 'Carousel', Gerry Marsden and his Pacemakers performed the song in Liverpool clubs during the birth of Merseybeat. "The audience would just stop, stand and listen. It had this immediate effect," says Marsden. Released in October 1963, YNWA was the Pacemakers' third consecutive number one and nowhere was it more popular than on the Kop, as fans sang along with the PA before matches. When it fell from the top spot, Kopites continued to sing it and YNWA has been played and sung at Anfield ever since.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
When you walk through a storm<br>
Hold your head up high<br>
And don't be afraid of the dark<br>
At the end of the storm<br>
Is a golden sky<br>
And the sweet silver song of a lark<br>
<br>
Walk on through the wind<br>
Walk on through the rain<br>
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown<br>
Walk on, walk on<br>
With hope in your heart<br>
And you'll never walk alone<br>
You'll never walk alone.<br>

<h2 align= "center"> 2. Fields Of Anfield Road </h2>
The original 'Fields Of Athenry' was written in 1979 and soon adopted by Celtic fans, but arguably the first time it was sung at Anfield was December 1995, when Ireland lost to Holland in their Euro 96 play-off. The website of Eircom, sponsors of the Republic side, recalls: "Nobody who was present at Anfield will ever forget the occasion. From the moment the Irish fans appeared in the famous Liverpool Kop, strains of 'The Fields Of Athenry' began to echo around the ground. At the other end, the massed ranks of Dutch supporters could only watch in admiration." The Liverpool version is believed to have originated in The Oakfield pub, home of the Liverpool Away Supporters Club, around 1997.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Outside the Shankly Gates<br>
I heard a Kopite calling<br>
Shankly they have taken you away<br>
But you left a great eleven<br>
Before you went to heaven<br>
Now it's glory round the Fields of Anfield Road.<br>
<br>
All round the Fields of Anfield Road<br>
Where once we watched the King Kenny play (and he could play)<br>
We had Heighway on the wing<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing<br>
Of the glory round the Fields of Anfield Road<br>
<br>
Outside the Paisley Gates<br>
I heard a Kopite calling<br>
Paisley they have taken you away<br>
You led the great 11<br>
Back in Rome in 77<br>
And the Redmen they are still playing the same way<br>
All round the Fields of Anfield Road<br>
Where once we watched the King Kenny play (and he could play)<br>
We had Heighway on the wing<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing<br>
Of the glory round the Fields of Anfield Road. <br>


<h2 align= "center"> 3. Liverbird Upon My Chest </h2> 

Originally a song called 'Ballad of the Green Berets' where Sergeant Barry Sadler wrote the lyrics and Robin Moore wrote the music. It was made into a film staring John Wayne. Was written as a Liverpool song in the mid 80s by Phil Aspinall but the original version only went as far as the 1986 cup final with the rest of the verses added since. Was first sung at a London game during the 1986-87 season, possibly Spurs.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Here's a song about a football team<br>
The greatest team you've ever seen<br>
A team that play total Football<br>
They've won the league, Europe and all.<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
With Kenny Dalglish on the ball<br>
He was the greatest of them all<br>
And Ian Rush, four goals or two<br>
Left Evertonians feeling blue<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
Now if you go down Goodison Way<br>
Hard luck stories you hear each day<br>
There's not a trophy to be seen<br>
'Cos Liverpool have swept them clean<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
Now on the glorious 10th of May<br>
There's laughing reds on Wembley Way<br>
We're full of smiles and joy and glee<br>
It's Everton 1 and Liverpool 3<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
Now on the 20th of May<br>
We're laughing still on Wembley Way<br>
Those Evertonians are feeling blue<br>
It's Liverpool 3 and Everton 2<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
And as we sang round Goodison Park<br>
With crying blues all in a nark<br>
They're probably crying still<br>
at Liverpool 5 and Everton nil.<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
We Remember them with pride<br>
Those mighty reds of Shankly's side<br>
And Kenny's boys of '88<br>
There's never been a side so great<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
Now back in 1965<br>
When great Bill Shankly was alive<br>
We're playing Leeds, the score's 1-1<br>
When it fell to the head of Ian St John<br>
<br>
A Liverbird upon my chest<br>
We are the men, of Shankly's best<br>
A team that plays the Liverpool way<br>
And wins the championship in May<br>
<br>
On April 15th '89<br>
What should have been a joyous time<br>
Ninety six Friends, we all shall miss<br>
And all the Kopites want justice (JUSTICE).<br>


<h2 align= "center">4.Poor Scouser Tommy </h2>
The first part comes from the US folk song 'Red River Valley', thought to have been written as 'The Bright Mohawk Valley' in the 19th century. The song can be heard in the final scenes of John Ford’s 1940 cinema classic 'The Grapes Of Wrath'. The second half of Scouser Tommy comes from the tune of 'The Sash', a song sung by the Orange Order.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Let me tell you the story of a poor boy<br>
Who was sent far away from his home<br>
To fight for his king and his country<br>
And also the old folks back home<br>
<br>
So they put him in a Highland division<br>
Sent him off to a far foreign land<br>
Where the flies swarm around in their thousands<br>
And there's nothing to see but the sands<br>
<br>
In a battle that started next morning<br>
Under an Arabian sun<br>
I remember that poor Scouser Tommy<br>
Who was shot by an old Nazi gun<br>

As he lay on the battle field dying dying dying<br>
With the blood gushing out of his head (of his head)<br>
As he lay on the battle field dying dying dying<br>
These were the last words he said...<br>

Oh... I am a Liverpudlian<br>
I come from the Spion Kop<br>
I like to sing, I like to shout<br>
I go there quite a lot (every week)<br>

We support the team that's dressed in Red<br>
A team that we all know<br>
A team that we call Liverpool<br>
And to glory we will go<br>

We've won the League, we've won the Cup<br>
We've been to Europe too<br>
We played the Toffees for a laugh<br>
And we left them feeling blue - Five Nil!<br>

One two<br>
One two three<br>
One two three four<br>
Five nil!<br>

Rush scored one<br>
Rush scored two<br>
Rush scored three<br>
And Rush scored four! <br>

<h2 align= "center">5.  When The Reds Go Marching In</h2>

Made famous by jazz trumpet legend Louis Armstrong, 'When the Saints Go Marching In' is the unofficial anthem of New Orleans with its roots in the spiritual music that evolved out of slavery. First performed vocally, it was later taken up by brass bands when discarded military instruments from the American Civil War found their way into the hands of black musicians. Southampton fans claim they were the first to sing the song in the 1960s, but it that's true, Liverpool can't have been far behind.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Oh when the Reds<br>
Go marching in<br>
Oh when the Reds go marching in<br>
I want to be in that number<br>
When the Reds go marching in.<br>

<h2 align= "center">6.L I V</h2>
Sung by the Kop since the 1970s, we have Andrew Lloyd Webber to thank for this classic. In 1971, the Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice rock opera 'Jesus Christ Superstar’' exploded onto the New York stage and by 1980 it had become the longest running West End musical. An album of the show’s music topped the US charts three times and the 1973 cinema release took £8.6 million at the box office. A less than kind 'Georgie Best' version did the rounds in the early 70s, but the classic Liverpool version is all that survives.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
L-I-V<br>
E-R-P<br>
Double-O L<br>
Liverpool FC !<br>

<h2 align= "center">7.Red & White Kop</h2>

Sung to the tune of the Beatles 'Yellow Submarine', this was first heard at Anfield in the 1960s. In those days it was not uncommon for football fans to adapt the latest hit records into songs about their team and with Merseybeat all the rage, Liverpool fans did it better than most. Strangely however for a city so obsessed with football, The Beatles appeared to be the only four men in Liverpool who weren't interested in the game.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
On a Saturday afternoon<br>
We support a team called Liverpool<br>
And we sing until we drop<br>
In a red and white Spion Kop<br>
We all live in a red and white Kop<br>
A red and white Kop<br>
A red and white Kop<br>
We all live in a red and white Kop<br>
A red and white Kop<br>
A red and white Kop<br>
In a town where I was born<br>
Lived a man who sailed the seas<br>
And he told me of his pride<br>
They were a famous football team<br>
So we trailed to Anfield Road,<br>
Singing songs of victory<br>
And there we found the holy ground,<br>
Of our hero Bill Shankly<br>
We all live in red and white Kop…<br>

<h2 align= "center">8.Bill Shankly From Glenbuck</h2>

Written by John Mackin from the Red All Over The Land website, 'Bill Shankly From Glenbuck' is sung to the tune of 'Sean South from Garryowen', a rebel song about an IRA volunteer who was shot dead in 1956 while attempting to attack an RUC base in Northern Ireland.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Twas on a cold December's day<br>
Back in 1959<br>
When a man came down from Hudersfield Town<br>
To lead the Anfield line<br>
He bought Yeats from Dundee and St. John<br>
And the football world was shook<br>
This man he became a legend<br>
Bill Shankly from Glenbuck.<br>
<br>
On the Kop we'd sway and sing<br>
Till our hearts would burst with pride<br>
And Shanks he made a pact with us<br>
To build another side<br>
With Keegan, Tosh and Steve Heighway<br>
The great man kept his word<br>
Then in '74 he bade farewell<br>
Our dear old Scottish Laird.<br>
<br>
Now when Shanks was gone we sang walk on<br>
But feared we'd walk alone,<br>
The search was on to find the one<br>
Who could fill the masters throne.<br>
The one we crowned became renowned<br>
Throughout the football game<br>
Three European Cups, six championships,<br>
Bob Paisley was his name.<br>
<br>
Now when Bob stepped down he left his crown<br>
Inside his Anfield home<br>
Joe Fagan came and brought new fame<br>
With a treble won in Rome<br>
Though the Heysel year left Joe in tears,<br>
The following year he'd sing,<br>
When we won the league and FA Cup<br>
And Kenny was our king.<br>
<br>
When he played in red Bob Paisley said<br>
He's the best he'd ever seen<br>
And the team he built in 88<br>
Ruled the football league supreme.<br>
And when Hillsborough left us all bereaved<br>
And the Kop bedecked in flowers,<br>
Kenny proved he truly was a king<br>
In Anfield's darkest hour.<br>
<br>
Now the mantles being past to a man from France<br>
And it's Houllier we praise.<br>
As the reds walk on, the Kops in song<br>
And we savour glory days<br>
Days of ball to feet, of victory sweet<br>
Days of passion, guile and fire<br>
The legacy of one so great<br>
Bill Shankly from Ayshire. <br>


<h2 align= "center">9.Underneath the Floodlights</h2>

Based on the song 'Lili Marlene', this Kop song first emerged in the late Seventies. The original song was based on a German poem from 1915 and soon became a favourite of both German and American troops during the Second World War, both in English and in the original German. A curious example of song transcending the hatreds of war, American troops particularly liked 'Lili Marlene' as sung by the German-born actress and singer, Marlene Dietrich.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
Underneath the floodlights<br>
Down in Dusseldorf<br>
All the kop were singing<br>
Bevvied up of course<br>
We've been to Lisbon and to Rome<br>
And our team "never walk alone"<br>
We're going off to Europe to bring the cup back home<br>
<br>
All the way from Anfield to the gates of Rome,<br>
All the way from Anfield to bring the trophy home,<br>
Nothing can stop us come what may,<br>
We'll have our say, this is our day,<br>
Liverpool's red army,<br>
Is marching on it's way.<br>

<h2 align= "center">10.Scouser in Gay Paris</h2>

Written by a group of Reds from the Canon Pub in Townsend Lane prior to the 1981 European Cup Final in Paris, this song doesn't get sung at the match but can be heard on occasion on trains and planes when Liverpool fans travel to away matches.
<br>Lyrics:<br>
How would you like to be<br>
A Scouser in Gay Paris<br>
Walking along on the banks of the Seine<br>
Winning the European Cup once again.<br>
We'll go up the Eiffel Tower<br>
And stay up there half an hour,<br>
Cos we won't be too late<br>
When we celebrate,<br>
We're the Scousers in Gay Paris.<br>

We'll visit the Follies Bergere<br>
They like to see Scousers there<br>
The woman are lovely<br>
With skin like a peach<br>
But they'll never move it like Kenny Dalglish<br>
<br>
How would you like to be<br>
A Scouser in Gay Paris.<br>
